# Interventions

SHARP works to actively promote NICE guidance interventions for psychosis (Nice guidance- take context 
for service set up from feasibility study and insert in terms of addressing areas of need. Show differences 
between our service and other i.e. currently no other services in England are devoted solely to 
implementing nice guidance by delivering evidence based interventions all in the one facility. 
No other service can tailor a programme to an individual's needs and provide this level of holistic 
care and integrated service provision)

> "It’s good to talk beyond medication, to try other things to help care about yourself"

> "The social aspect important, my problem is loneliness so I was glad that it’s not drug based. 
> This is more productive than meds groups because help each other"
