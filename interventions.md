# Interventions

{% capture content %}
SHARP offers the entire range of NICE recommended interventions for psychosis. We are also a research 
hub that offers additional support to people via pilot studies. We have been able to offer a broad range 
of newly researched interventions such as SLoMO, AVatar and walking groups currently not on offer anywhere else. 
We also offer a range of wellbeing initiatives in partnership with the wider community such as gym, 
better with a book and SHARP gallery. We tailor each programme to individual's needs according to mind, 
body and flow. We understand that people may have more than one area of need and provide an integrated and 
holistic approach (Nice, 2017).
