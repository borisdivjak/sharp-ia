# Research and innovation


{% capture content %}
SHARP continues to be involved in research with King’s Health Partners and IOPPN. SHARP has 
facilitated pilot studies for ACT, AVATAR, Personalisation and My Health Locker and numerous 
other studies. We have been integral to the recruitment and facilitation process, enabling 
studies to run which may have been challenged due to site and participation barriers. We 
continue to be at the cutting edge of service delivery, incorporating new trialled and tested 
interventions into our core therapy offering such as mindfulness and ACT.

### Pilot site and centre for Research


SHARP have participated and supported a range of other research interventions. SHARP was a pilot site for recruitment, 
training and delivery of interventions. 

SHARP have also created a part time post which dedicates 1 day a week to research in Occupational Therapy. This post aims to: 
1) Investigate the impact Occupational Therapists have in the area of Social Inclusion; 
2) Promote at a local level, the importance of Occupational Therapy research within a clinical setting.

There is also a role dedicated to service evaluation and research, enabling SHARP to provide evidence and findings on its programme. 

SHARP psychologists were trained in delivering [AVATAR Therapy](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/avatar-project/therapy.aspx) and seeing participants. 
 
Pilot site for recruitment and training delivery for [Consent For Contact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296527/) 
research into recruitment for mental health research. ‘Consent for Contact’ (C4C) enabled a framework 
to expedite recruitment and contribute to equitable access to research.
