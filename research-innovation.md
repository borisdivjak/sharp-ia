# Research and innovation


{% capture content %}
SHARP continues to be involved in research with King’s Health Partners and IOPPN. SHARP has 
facilitated pilot studies for ACT, AVATAR, Personalisation and My Health Locker and numerous 
other studies. We have been integral to the recruitment and facilitation process, enabling 
studies to run which may have been challenged due to site and participation barriers. We 
continue to be at the cutting edge of service delivery, incorporating new trialled and tested 
interventions into our core therapy offering such as mindfulness and ACT.
