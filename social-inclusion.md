# Increased social inclusion and well-being


{% capture content %}
SHARP plays an integral part in building and sustaining communities, networks and supports for people 
in Lambeth who experience psychosis. The people we work with experience severe and enduring illness 
that impacts their lives on a daily basis. SHARP support people in their recovery and build strengthen 
the core economy through increasing people’s resilience and independence. By providing opportunities to 
learn and take calculated risks we help build and strengthen people’s support to access their local community.

The Time budget (Jolley et al, 2006) is carried out as a structured interview with the service user 
reporting on how they spend their time over a typical week. It is scored based on degree of planning, 
complexity and effort required for activity of a typical week using a scale of 0-4.

The above indicates a significant (p<0.001) increase in activity level.

such as health, relationships, job and living situation.

The Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS; Haddock et al, 1999) are two scales: one scale for auditory 
hallucinations and one scale for delusions. Each scale measures the presence and severity of a number 
of different dimensions of the psychotic symptom. The scales are appropriate for measuring outcomes 
to treatment for positive psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia/ psychosis in terms of changes in 
symptom severity and can also be used to assess how symptom dimensions co-vary over time/with treatment.

Results from those engaging in psychological interventions since attending SHARP show a statistically 
significant reduction (p<0.005) in distressing psychotic symptoms, auditory hallucinations and/or delusions.

## Physical Health

SHARP is dedicated to promoting positive physical health behaviours and lifestyle changes among 
Lambeth residents experiencing psychosis who are  at high risk of complications due lack of physical 
activity, poor diet and self-care.

_"In the UK, the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals with psychotic illnesses 
is much higher than that observed in national general population studies as well as in most international 
studies of patients with psychosis."_ (Gardener-Stood, et al, 2015).

## Self management

SHARP empowers people by building on their personal strengths. We take the hopes and dreams of the 
people we work with and turn them into achievable goals. With each success along the way people feel 
more confident to grow, living life beyond a mental health diagnosis.
