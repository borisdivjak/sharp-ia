SHARP is a specialist team of Mental Health Professionals focused on recovery and well-being 
for people using mental health services in Lambeth. We want every adult in Lambeth with a diagnosis 
of psychosis to be physically healthy, actively engaged in their community, achieving their goals 
and moving forward with their lives.
