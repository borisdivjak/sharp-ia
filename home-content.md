SHARP is a specialist team of Mental Health Professionals focused on recovery and well-being. 
We work with adults with psychosis who access secondary care mental health services in Lambeth, London. 
Our hope is that as a result of accessing SHARP people can be physically healthy, actively engaged in their community, 
achieving their goals and moving forward with their lives.

This impact assessment has been completed in order to evaluate SHARP’s work over the last decade 
in meeting unmet needs of people in Lambeth and to review SHARP’s performance in accordance with 
trust and wider mental health objectives.
