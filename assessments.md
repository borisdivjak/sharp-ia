# Assessment


{% capture content %}
SHARP provides an individualised, person centred assessment using proven measures to provide objective data 
which supports qualitative feedback and measures change. The most important part is to know we have captured 
the person’s needs so we can be sure we work with them in a way that best suits them.

The importance of measuring the effectiveness of services and the need for recording outcomes is increasingly 
recognised ([IFG, 2010](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/The%20state%20of%20commissioning.pdf)). 
SHARP uses of a range of [health based outcome measures](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Beyond%20Big%20Contracts.pdf) 
selected to assess desired outcomes for the people who use our service.

In order to understand the needs of the people we work with across the areas of Mind, Body and Flow 
SHARP employs a range of standardised outcomes based measures to best capture change in symptoms, wellbeing, 
activity levels and all domains of life.
