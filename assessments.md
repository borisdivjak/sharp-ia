employs a range of standardised outcomes based measures to best capture change in symptoms, wellbeing,

The importance of measuring the effectiveness of services and the need for recording outcomes is increasingly 
recognised ([IFG, 2010](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/The%20state%20of%20commissioning.pdf)). 
SHARP uses of a range of [health based outcome measures](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Beyond%20Big%20Contracts.pdf) 
selected to assess desired outcomes for the people who use our service.
