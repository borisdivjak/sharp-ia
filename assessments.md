### Focus on outcomes

The importance of measuring the effectiveness of services and the need for recording outcomes is increasingly 
recognised ([IFG, 2010](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/The%20state%20of%20commissioning.pdf)). 
SHARP uses of a range of [health based outcome measures](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Beyond%20Big%20Contracts.pdf) 
selected to assess desired outcomes for the people who use our service.

### Mind, Body, and Flow framework

Well-being means looking after our bodies, minds and getting into a flow of what we want to do. 
Each element interacts with the other and is key to leading a balanced and full life.
