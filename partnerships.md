# Partnerships

One of the needs identified by staff and workers of Lambeth in the feasibility study was the need 
for SHARP to be able to provide connections within the community and help bridge the gap between 
services and unmet need. One of the ways in which SHARP has been successful in addressing this 
is through collaboration, co-production and the effective use of partnership work.

We have successfully partnered with organisations including voluntary sector, businesses and learning 
institutions.

## Collaboration with the Comedy School, Ritzy Cinema and Recovery College 

An example of this has been our recent partnership work and collaboration with the Comedy School, 
Ritzy cinema and recovery college to co-produce an annual event in honor of world mental health day. 
The series of improvisation workshops and events have had a major impact on people’s well-being.
