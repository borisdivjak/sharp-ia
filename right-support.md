### The whole is more than the sum of it’s parts

SHARP provides a single point of entry for multiple interventions – one assessment 
to access all. This also benefits people in that all interventions are offered ine one place – enabling a process 
of getting to know and feel comfortable with staff and developing the confidence to explore other interventions 
which the individual may find more challenging to engage in.

> "Really impressed, they provided a wide range of things I could participate in."

> "The combination of having the three interventions provided by one team was invaluable 
> and marked the difference to what we had been offered in the past. The service we received 
> was totally personalised, supporting both our needs in a way that was totally respectful."
